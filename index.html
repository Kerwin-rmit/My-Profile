   <p>I am interested in artificial intelligence and network. I became interested in network when I was in primary school, because I like playing online computer game and often encounter hacker player. Morever, interesting in artificial intelligence cause my uncle gives me the idea. His job is relate to IT and tells me AI wii be popular.</p>
   <P>Because I got an offer of foundation from RMIT University and graduated. I hope I can learn some practical knowledge to help in my future work.</p>

     <td colspan="6">
    <p>My idea job is to work in Tencent as a techincal operator. What attract me to this jobe is that being an operator in an Internet giant is a very capable job and it also proves that I have the ability to make dicisions and lead the team.</p>
    <p>This job requires mastery of computer network architecture and common programming language such as C++, PYTHON, PHP, SHELL... </p>
    <p>I currently don't have enough the skills, qualifications or experience to apply for this job. So I need to learn the basic computer network architeture and programming language during my university years. And then learn how to use those skills better during the internship.</p>

    <p>In personal growth test, the result says as a sociable personality, you enjoy being around people and are both comfortable with and energized by social interactions. While you enjoy certain things in solitude or small groups, you’re generally drawn to mingling, networking, and sharing a good time in a larger gathering. However, the quality of social interaction is important to you as well as quantity. If a setting feels stagnant, or a group seems listless, you’d rather move on. This result means to me that I like teamwork more and also like to have good relationships with my team members. I care about the relationships that people have with each other when building a team.</p>
    <p>In the test, it turned out that I was the initiator of the discussion with bias. When joining a group, you tend to assume that you’re welcome, diving in and introducing yourself to anyone you don’t know. If a conversation is already in progress, you add your two cents. If people are standing around, you happily suggest something to boost the energy in the gathering. I think I will have good leadership skills in a team</p>

     <th height="160" bgcolor="BurlyWood">Project Idea:</th>
     <td colspan="6">
    <p>My project idea is to create a credit card fraud detection system. It will be an IT project involving big data analysis, artificial intelligence and computer algorithms.The main characteristics of credit card fraud are constructed by computer programming and mathematical model, and the machine learning method is applied to automatically identify the suspected stolen credit card transactions. Finally, the intelligent program for real-time monitoring of credit card fraud is generated.</p>
    <p>The risk of stealing credit card has become one of the difficult problems in credit card departments of banks all over the world.
In the United States alone, for example, the Federal Reserve's payment survey reported that in 2012, the total amount of credit card payments in the United States reached 26 billion dollars, of which the amount of unauthorized credit card payments, that is, the amount of stolen credit cards was 6.1 billion dollars. Measuring the risk of credit card transactions involves a complex array of technologies, ranging from finance to economics to law to information science. Traditional credit card swiping detection requires a lot of human effort, with a human auditor calling to determine if the transaction is suspected of credit card theft. Now, as transactions surge, credit card departments of major banks are relying on big data and using machine learning and cloud computing methods to quickly identify suspected credit card transactions.</p>
    <p>Credit card payment is a common way of payment in our daily life. Of course, there will be fraud (credit card theft). If machine learning can be used to complete the prediction of fraud, it will help card issuers to realize anti-fraud and protect the security of cardholders' property.Traditional credit card detection requires a lot of human involvement in analyzing huge amounts of data, and the algorithm alerts only one transaction before a human reviewer calls to determine if the transaction is suspected of credit card theft. Now, as transactions surge, credit card departments of major banks are relying on big data and using machine learning and cloud computing methods to quickly identify unauthorized credit card transactions. Machine learning algorithms used to detect credit cards will first be trained on massive amounts of normal transaction data and cardholder data. Transaction results -- a normal person might buy electricity once a week, go to the shopping mall once every two weeks, and so on -- would become an important dimension in the machine's understanding of transactions. These transaction results would become models for normal transactions. Next, the machine is tested with real-time transaction data and given a probability of whether the transaction is illegal, say, 97 percent. If the detection system sets the probability of each transaction not being illegal to be higher than 95 percent, then all those transactions will be denied payment. In other words, the transaction will not succeed. This algorithm takes into account many factors, including the trust of the card swiping supplier, the purchase behavior of card insertion (space-time dimension), IP address, etc. The more factors it considers, the more accurate the model it builds. The process of detection is almost real time, which is also a human worker can not achieve detection speed.</p>
    <P>If this project is successful it means credit card users around the world are protected.<p>
